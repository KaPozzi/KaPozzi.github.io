One thing is clear, AI has become part of our life now. 

Whatever you’re doing or field you’re in, using the help of AI has shortened time and given direction for those who are facing a problem or seek for knowledge. But here’s one thing you’re probably missing: We can use this tool to simulate situations.

Right now i’m looking for getting knowledge and improve toubleshooting skills in DevOps. For this i’m putting on ChatGPT something like this: 

”You’re now a CTO, and you wish to give me this task to automate the deploy process in Azure. Give me the especifications, simulating a real company scenario and give me deadlines.” 

The return is going to blow your mind. 

It will give you everything you asked and maybe more. Then your job is to take these especifications and go for it! Try to solve the problem and deliver on time, while facing some bugs, being confused at times… believe me, that’s normal. 

One thing i learned in my experience is that even in a real company, not all information comes clear and perfect, so part of the experience is not only the technical knowledge as well, but be able to deal with people and try make the best solution with what you have. 

For me, that’s the real difference between a Course and real world experience.
