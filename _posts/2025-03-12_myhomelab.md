# My homelab

Not too long ago, i set up my first homelab, but at the time, i didn’t know how important it is to document my steps while doing so. Then, i’m starting over again! 

With a little more knowledge and experience, i’ll try to share with you my journey, hoping i can help somebody along the way.

My homelab is a Dell Optiplex with an i3 CPU and 8Gb of RAM and that’s it. As you can see, is not a fancy machine or anything complex but an old PC i had at home. Until now, this works for me really well, so this is everything i need. 

# Goals

The main goal is to end up managing apps in a Kubernetes cluster, and make it a sort of a Home Manager, where i can put some helpful things like a camera system, or host applications like Jellyfin, for my daughter.

For this i’m gonna use Ubuntu Server and install a “DevOps package” with Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes, Grafana, Python and much more. 

I want to set up Security, a GitOps environment, a VPN connection so i can access outside my Private Network and with backups. 

I think this is going to take some time, a lot of work to do, but i’m very excited to have fun with it and learn A LOT.
